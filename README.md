Linra (LINear algebRA library) is a library where you can find implementations of some not-so-popular operations of the subject. I'm just tired of that endless hand computation :/. Also, library don't (in process xd) have any dependencies. 

TODO:
1. Diagonalization of the quadratic form's matrices.
2. Solving a system of linear equations over Z\_p.
3. Gram-Schmidt ortogonalization with a *given* dot product.
4. Get rid of numpy. Should be no dependecies.
